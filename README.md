# Opteamal Code Challenge: Competition Standings App

## Overview

This challenge tasks you with creating a Standings Application using Nuxt 2.
Your Application will display the current standings of a selected competition and will also provide the user with details of the teams within the competition.

### Project Setup

A Nuxt 2 project template with Boostrap-Vue is provided as the base for this challenge.
You are required to use this template. Feel free to install additional packages as needed to complete the challenge.

## Challenge Requirements

### Main Page

- **Selection:** You should create a small card with some selection possibilities:

  - The country
  - The league
  - The season
  - Optional round: some competitions ,like the belgian competition, are played in different phases. For example a regular season and play-offs. In that case the user should also be able to select the phase of the competition

- **Standings:** Based on this selection, the homepage should feature a table displaying the standings for the chosen competition including:
  - Rank
  - Logo
  - Team
  - Games Played
  - Points
  - Wins
  - Draws
  - Losses
  - Goal Difference
  - Form (result of last 5 games played as W/D/L)

### Team Details

- **Click to:** Clicking on a row within the table should lead the user to a new page with detailed information of the club that is selected.

- **General Information:** On the detail page the user can find a card with some general information of the club:

  - Country
  - City
  - Stadium (address, capacity, surface, ...)
  - Image of the stadium

- **Season Information:** The user should also find some information of the season statistics based on the selection that was made on the Main Page:

  - Total Form
  - Goals For
  - Goals Against
  - Wins
  - Draws
  - Losses
  - ...

- **Players:** Underneath the information, a table with all the current players should be provided with the following information:

  - Photo
  - Shirtnumber
  - Name
  - Age
  - Position

- **Data Persistence:** Utilize a store to manage the selections made on the Main Page. Ensure persistence of this data to maintain the Selection when returning from the Team Details back to the Main Page.

### API Integration

- To fetch the data, you are to use the [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3). The api calls should be made usign Axios and the API key should be provided within a `.env` file.
  The API Key will be provided before the start of your assignment.
  The packages axios & @nuxtjs/axios are already included in the `package.json` file. However, they are not yet included in for example the `nuxt.config.js`.

- **Get /countries:** Use the get countries endpoint to fetch the countries for the Selection.

- **Get /leagues:** Use the get leagues endpoint to fetch the leagues within the countries.

- **Get /leagues/seasons:** Use the get leagues/seasons endpoint to fetch the seasons of a selected league.

- **Get /standings:** Use the get standings endpoint to fetch the standings for a given league and season. If a competition has more than one round, the endpoint will return more than one _standings_.
  The round Selection dropdown can be created based on this response.

- **Get /teams:** Use the get teams endpoint to fetch the team & stadium information.

- **Get /teams/statistics:** Use the get teams endpoint to fetch the team statistics based on the state Selections (team and season).

- **Get /players/teams:** Use the get players/teams endpoint to fetch the players within the selected team.
